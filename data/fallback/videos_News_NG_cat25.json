The police are currently investigating the crime.\n\nAfter her passing was announced, tributes have poured in including from the Governor of Anambra State, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, and the Minister for Information, Mohammed Idris, among others.\n\nIn Kogi State, Barrister Onyesom Peace Udoka was kidnapped alongside her sister, Gift Onyesom, near Lokoja on Friday, September 26th. The reported kidnapping took place just four days after Peace was Called to the Bar in Abuja.\n\nHer abductors are said to be demanding N40 Million Naira to release both victims.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association has called on the Federal Government and security agencies to swiftly secure the release of its member, describing the incident as “unacceptable and utterly condemnable”. \n\nIn Kwara State, residents of Ajase-Ipo and surrounding communities staged a massive protest, alleging that a recent surge in deadly attacks and bloodletting was orchestrated with the help of a mysterious helicopter.\n\nThe community, some of whom were seen fleeing in viral videos, accused security operatives of collusion and abandonment. The state government is now calling for increased military presence in the region. \n\n#SomtochukwuChristelleMaduagwu #AriseNews #Journalist #NigerianJournalist #NewsAnchor #Somtochukwu #ArmedRobber #InsecurityInNigeria #Insecurity #Katampe #Abuja #FCT #AbujaInsecurity #NigeriaPolice #Police #Anambra #AnambraState #Soludo #ChukwumaSoludo #MohammedIdris #KogiState #CallToBar #NigerianLawyer #Law #LawAndJustice #Investigation #Investigate #NigerianBar #NigerianBarAssociation #Lokoja #Kidnapping #Kidnap #Bandit #Banditry #Ransom #Nigerian #NigerianGovernment #KwaraState #Kwara #InsecurityInNigeria #AjaseIpo #NigerianMilitary #OjyOkpe #TrendingNews #PoliticalDebate #NigerianTalent #NaijaNews #Updates #PoliticalControversy #Accountability #PublicDiscourse #ViralVideo #NigeriaDecides #NationalIssues #SocialCommentary #PowerStruggle #PoliticalInfighting #APC #Diplomacy #Governance #NationalSecurity #Economy #Inflation #Naira #CBN #ElectionFraud #VoterAwareness #NigerianDemocracy\n\n\nSubscribe to our Channel for high profile interviews.

The $300M Scandal Shaking Nigerian Politics\n\nIn this video, we dive deep into one of the biggest political showdowns of 2025 — the clash between FCT Minister Nyesom Wike and activist/journalist Omoyele Sowore.\n\nFrom Abuja’s corridors of power to petitions in the United States, this feud has gone far beyond social media jabs. Allegations of $300 million Ogoniland cleanup funds, luxury properties in Florida, and corruption scandals are now at the center of Nigeria’s political conversation.\n\n👉 Who is telling the truth?\n👉 Can Sowore’s activism shake the foundations of Abuja’s political elite?\n👉 And will Minister Nyesom Wike, known for his powerful role in the FCT, face accountability?\n\nThis isn’t just about two men — it’s about Nigeria’s democracy, corruption, and the future of governance.\n\n💬 What do you think: Is Sowore exposing the truth, or is this just another round of political mudslinging?

        "description": "Donald Trump has unveiled a sweeping 20-point peace plan to end the Gaza war—after meeting Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. The deal promises a ceasefire, prisoner swaps, an international transitional government for Gaza, economic revival, and even hints at a future Palestinian state. Netanyahu has backed the plan—but ruled out Palestinian statehood. Hamas has yet to respond, and Trump has given them just 3–4 days. Meanwhile, Arab nations, world leaders, and even India are weighing in. Will this bold plan finally bring peace to West Asia—or collapse like so many before it? Palki Sharma tells you.\n\n---\n\nDonald Trump | Benjamin Netanyahu | Palestine | Gaza | Hamas | Trump Gaza Peace Plan | 20-Point Peace Proposal | Netanyahu Trump Meeting | Gaza Ceasefire Deal | Prisoner Swap Agreement | Gaza Transitional Government | Economic Revival Gaza | Palestinian State Debate | Hamas Response Pending | Arab Nations React | Firstpost | World News | News Live | Vantage | Palki Sharma | News\n\n#trumppeaceplan #gazaconflict #netanyahutrump #gaza #palestinianstate #hamasresponse #middleeastpeace #arabnations #westasiapeace #gazaceasefire #firstpost #vantageonfirstpost #palkisharma #worldnews\n\nVantage is a ground-breaking news, opinions, and current affairs show from Firstpost.

          "description": "Donald Trump has unveiled a sweeping 20-point peace plan to end the Gaza war—after meeting Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. The deal promises a ceasefire, prisoner swaps, an international transitional government for Gaza, economic revival, and even hints at a future Palestinian state. Netanyahu has backed the plan—but ruled out Palestinian statehood. Hamas has yet to respond, and Trump has given them just 3–4 days. Meanwhile, Arab nations, world leaders, and even India are weighing in. Will this bold plan finally bring peace to West Asia—or collapse like so many before it? Palki Sharma tells you.\n\n---\n\nDonald Trump | Benjamin Netanyahu | Palestine | Gaza | Hamas | Trump Gaza Peace Plan | 20-Point Peace Proposal | Netanyahu Trump Meeting | Gaza Ceasefire Deal | Prisoner Swap Agreement | Gaza Transitional Government | Economic Revival Gaza | Palestinian State Debate | Hamas Response Pending | Arab Nations React | Firstpost | World News | News Live | Vantage | Palki Sharma | News\n\n#trumppeaceplan #gazaconflict #netanyahutrump #gaza #palestinianstate #hamasresponse #middleeastpeace #arabnations #westasiapeace #gazaceasefire #firstpost #vantageonfirstpost #palkisharma #worldnews\n\nVantage is a ground-breaking news, opinions, and current affairs show from Firstpost.

The ministry also shared a video showing Thunberg.\nSeveral ships were targeted by acts of “active aggression”, it said. “Florida vessel has been deliberately rammed at sea. Yulara, Meteque and others have been targeted with water cannons,” it said on Telegram.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Felix Nyawara reports.\nAl Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim explains what will come next for the activists, who have been arrested.\nHuwaida Arraf is an activist, who's part of the Freedom Flotilla, which is currently sailing for Gaza. \nShe says the international community is failing in its legal obligations, not just towards the flotilla, but also the Palestinian victims of Israel's genocide  \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDownload AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n#GlobalSumudFlotilla #GSF #SumudFlotillaIntercepted #Israel #Palestine #Gaza #IsraeliNavy #GazaWar #GazaFamine #GazaGenocide #AlJazeeraEnglish"

        "description": "The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan left behind nearly $7 billion worth of military equipment, much of which fell into Taliban control. After a 20-year U.S. investment of nearly $1 trillion, the abandoned weapons — including M-4 rifles, M-16 rifles, and advanced gear — have shifted the balance of power. This U.S. weapons left in Afghanistan issue now fuels global concerns, with reports of these arms reaching militant groups such as al-Qaeda affiliates. The Taliban’s seizure of over one million weapons and equipment highlights the devastating financial and strategic consequences of America’s longest war.\n\nIn this video you will see:\nFootage of U.S. weapons left in Afghanistan after withdrawal.\nTaliban fighters seizing M-4s and M-16s from Afghan bases.\n$7 billion in abandoned military gear turned into Taliban stockpiles.\nHow U.S. weapons are now empowering militants across the region.\n\nExpert Insight:\nThe Taliban’s arsenal is America’s own war legacy — reshaping threats the U.S. tried to eliminate.\n\nStay Connected:\n🔔 Subscribe to Global Military Forum for more powerful military comparisons and updates.\n👍 Like, comment, and share if you found this comparison engaging.\n\nCredits:\nThanks to the Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)\n for official military releases.\n\nMusic Credits:\nBTS Prolog · Kevin MacLeod\n℗ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nHashtags:\n#USWeaponsAfghanistan #TalibanArsenal #AfghanistanWar #MilitaryFailure #GlobalMilitaryForum #USWithdrawal #WarLegacy \n\nCopyright Disclaimer:\nUnder Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.

          "title": "America’s Arsenal Now in Taliban Hands!",
          "description": "The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan left behind nearly $7 billion worth of military equipment, much of which fell into Taliban control. After a 20-year U.S. investment of nearly $1 trillion, the abandoned weapons — including M-4 rifles, M-16 rifles, and advanced gear — have shifted the balance of power. This U.S. weapons left in Afghanistan issue now fuels global concerns, with reports of these arms reaching militant groups such as al-Qaeda affiliates. The Taliban’s seizure of over one million weapons and equipment highlights the devastating financial and strategic consequences of America’s longest war.\n\nIn this video you will see:\nFootage of U.S. weapons left in Afghanistan after withdrawal.\nTaliban fighters seizing M-4s and M-16s from Afghan bases.\n$7 billion in abandoned military gear turned into Taliban stockpiles.\nHow U.S. weapons are now empowering militants across the region.\n\nExpert Insight:\nThe Taliban’s arsenal is America’s own war legacy — reshaping threats the U.S. tried to eliminate.\n\nStay Connected:\n🔔 Subscribe to Global Military Forum for more powerful military comparisons and updates.\n👍 Like, comment, and share if you found this comparison engaging.\n\nCredits:\nThanks to the Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)\n for official military releases.\n\nMusic Credits:\nBTS Prolog · Kevin MacLeod\n℗ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\nHashtags:\n#USWeaponsAfghanistan #TalibanArsenal #AfghanistanWar #MilitaryFailure #GlobalMilitaryForum #USWithdrawal #WarLegacy \n\nCopyright Disclaimer:\nUnder Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.
