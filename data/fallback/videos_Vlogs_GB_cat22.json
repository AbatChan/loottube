          "description": "Travel day is here and I’m off to Universal Orlando Resort in Florida for a week of thrills, Halloween fun and my very first stay at Universal’s Aventura Hotel. This trip kicks off with an overnight at the Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminal 2 before flying Virgin Atlantic Upper Class from Heathrow Terminal 3 to Orlando International Airport (MCO). Once in Florida, I make a Publix stop for some essentials before checking into Aventura and heading straight to Halloween Horror Nights for Premium Scream Night. From Universal’s futuristic Prime Value hotel to reduced-capacity haunted houses, themed scare zones, exclusive food offerings and stormy Florida weather, this vlog covers an epic first day at Universal Orlando Resort.\n\nTravel Wallet (ad/affiliate link): https://amzn.to/47ImZJr\n\n✨🔑 JOIN THE MOOOORNING CLUB: https://www.patreon.com/adamhattan Unlock the magic within, with exclusive access to bonus content, a members Instagram, entries to competitions, welcome gifts and more (subject to membership tier). ✨\n\nI’m Adam Hattan, a family-friendly theme park and vacation vlogger from the UK.

During a pre-travel overnight stay at the Hilton Garden Inn at Terminal 2, I show you around my family room, share my first impressions of the space and try room service with a paneer curry, chips and a classic banana split dessert before an early flight the next morning on travel day.\n\nMy travel day vlog officially starts with Virgin Atlantic in Upper Class on an Airbus A330-900 neo from London Heathrow to Orlando International Airport. From check-in to security and a stop at the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse lounge, take a look at the Upper Class seat, meal service and inflight entertainment. A full transatlantic travel experience. After arriving in Orlando, I meet my transfer driver and make a stop at Publix to stock up on water, snacks and essentials before heading to Universal’s Aventura Hotel.\n\nThis is my first stay at Universal’s Aventura Hotel, a Prime Value property at Universal Orlando Resort. I give a first look at the futuristic tower, my standard room (which happens to overlook Volcano Bay), the in-room iPad controls, amenities and dining options in the lobby. With Starbucks, quick service food, a Universal Studios Store and access to the pools at neighbouring resorts, Aventura makes for a great base to explore.\n\nThe evening is all about Halloween Horror Nights and the reasonably new Premium Scream Night event. This special ticket includes unlimited food, 'shorter' waits for the houses and a lower overall capacity. With rainstorms rolling in, I head into scare zones such as Origins of Horror, Masquerade of Death and the Cat Lady of Crooked Lane, and experience houses including WWE Presents: The Horrors of The Wyatt Sicks and Grave of Flesh. I also check out the relocated Tribute Store and meet up with Tim and Jenn Tracker for some food and frights, including the enormous mozzarella stick and freakishly long corndog.\n\nFrom the stormy weather to reduced crowds, Premium Scream Night offers a very different Halloween Horror Nights experience. I share my honest review and overall thoughts on the event, who it’s best suited for, and how it compares to a regular night at Universal Orlando Resort’s Halloween Horror Nights.\n\nSubscribe and turn on 🔔 notifications so you don’t miss the rest of this Universal Orlando Resort series, with more vlogs from the parks, Aventura Hotel, and an additional night at Halloween Horror Nights.
