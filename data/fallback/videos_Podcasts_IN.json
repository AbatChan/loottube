        "description": "Madhavaneni Raghunandan Rao ‚Äì MP Lok Sabha, Medak constituency, Ex-MLA (Dubbak) , and a Lawyer by profession.\n\nIn this Telugu podcast episode, we sit down with Raghunandan Rao, to uncover the harsh realities of Indian politics. Known for his bold voice, Rao speaks candidly about one of the most debated issues today; over 250 parliamentarians facing criminal cases. He reflects on the charges against him, the toll they take on families, and why the system itself needs a serious rethink. From the controversial ‚ÄúBJP washing machine‚Äù narrative to the gap between perception and reality, nothing is left unsaid.\n\nRao also shares the resilience that kept him going despite multiple defeats, comparing politics to Darwin‚Äôs theory of survival, using the giraffe & dinosaur example. He questions the double standards around freedom of speech, why anonymous trolls are tolerated while political voices face silencing, and how social media has reshaped the language of politics in India.\n\nBeyond speeches and headlines, he reveals the everyday life of a politician; endless public interactions, health issues like BP and diabetes, heavy spending on hospitality, and the emotional cost on families. He also weighs in on Telangana‚Äôs contribution to central taxes, the rise in petrol prices, and whether national parties like BJP can break through in states rooted in regional identities.\n\nFrom courtroom battles to political wars, from personal regrets to advice for the youth, this episode brings out the unfiltered side of a leader who has built his career on persistence and outspoken conviction. If you're someone curious about the complex mix of power, politics, and survival in India, this is an episode you can‚Äôt afford to miss.\n\n.\nDisclaimer: This video is for educational purposes only.

We further talked about why SRK became a big brand and is loved by everyone, his experience meeting him, the story of him running away from home when he was 7 years old, and why he chose Karan Aujla to write the song G.O.A.T. He also shared stories from his childhood and how his perspective and life changed in 2020. \n\nWe further talked about why many artists don‚Äôt become successful after 5-7 years in their career and what is he doing right to stay relevant for so many years. We discussed why he works with new artists most of the time and how his music production changed after G.O.A.T. Towards the end, we talked about his love life, his first love, and his diet.
