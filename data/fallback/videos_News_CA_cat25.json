But here’s where it gets shocking…\n\nThe ingredient in question is azodicarbonamide—a substance that helps bread look whiter, puffier, and more appealing. Sounds harmless, right? Well, here’s the kicker: it’s also found in yoga mats and shoe soles. 🧘👟\n\nThis raised eyebrows worldwide because most people never imagined their favorite sandwich bread could share an ingredient with gym equipment and sneakers. While food scientists argue that azodicarbonamide is “generally recognized as safe” in small amounts, consumer advocates pushed back hard.\n\n🍞 Why does it matter?\nThis moment highlights a bigger food debate: What should and shouldn’t be allowed in what we eat?

          "description": "Prime Minister Mark Carney faced off with Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre in question period for the first time since Poilievre's return to the House of Commons. Mackenzie Gray looks at the pair's first debate, the takeaways as the fall session of parliament begins and what the Liberals need to pass their fall budget.\n\nAffordability is top of mind for many Canadians feeling the squeeze on basic needs like food and housing. As Heather Yourex-West explains, many people are struggling to buy their first home even though prices are dropping in some cities.\n\nAmerican and Chinese officials have reached a tentative deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S., where the popular social media app was on the verge of being banned over national security concerns. Jackson Proskow reports on how the two countries reached a framework agreement and the suspicions about who might end up owning TikTok.\n\nPlus, Vancouver filmmaking duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's Apple TV+ series ‘The Studio’ enjoyed a historic night at the Emmys, setting a record for the most wins for a comedy show in a single season. Eric Sorensen looks at Rogen and Goldberg's rise as a powerful force in Hollywood.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/11425111/house-of-commons-fall-members-of-parliament/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on X HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #GlobalNational #QuestionPeriod",

            "description": "Prime Minister Mark Carney faced off with Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre in question period for the first time since Poilievre's return to the House of Commons. Mackenzie Gray looks at the pair's first debate, the takeaways as the fall session of parliament begins and what the Liberals need to pass their fall budget.\n\nAffordability is top of mind for many Canadians feeling the squeeze on basic needs like food and housing. As Heather Yourex-West explains, many people are struggling to buy their first home even though prices are dropping in some cities.\n\nAmerican and Chinese officials have reached a tentative deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S., where the popular social media app was on the verge of being banned over national security concerns. Jackson Proskow reports on how the two countries reached a framework agreement and the suspicions about who might end up owning TikTok.\n\nPlus, Vancouver filmmaking duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's Apple TV+ series ‘The Studio’ enjoyed a historic night at the Emmys, setting a record for the most wins for a comedy show in a single season. Eric Sorensen looks at Rogen and Goldberg's rise as a powerful force in Hollywood.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/11425111/house-of-commons-fall-members-of-parliament/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on X HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #GlobalNational #QuestionPeriod"
