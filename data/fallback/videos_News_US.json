The country has taken steps to prevent future 'mass movements by vested interests'. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has ordered a report to be prepared analyzing the history, causes and financial aspects of all movements in India after 1974. Critics say that the BJP government has taken such an initiative out of fear that the governments have been ousted from power due to protests by youth in the three South Asian countries.\n\nContent Declaration: \n=================\nThis content is for news purpose.

The country has taken steps to prevent future 'mass movements by vested interests'. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has ordered a report to be prepared analyzing the history, causes and financial aspects of all movements in India after 1974. Critics say that the BJP government has taken such an initiative out of fear that the governments have been ousted from power due to protests by youth in the three South Asian countries.\n\nContent Declaration: \n=================\nThis content is for news purpose.
