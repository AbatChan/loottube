        "description": "Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk engaged in heated debates with students at the University of California San Diego in what would become his final campus appearance before his tragic death at Utah Valley University. During the event, Kirk defended President Trump's cabinet appointments against criticism, argued for the elimination of the Department of Education, and engaged in extensive discussions about immigration policy. The debates covered topics ranging from Pete Hegseth's military leadership qualifications to the economic impact of illegal immigration, with Kirk maintaining his characteristic rapid-fire debating style against prepared student questioners. The event highlighted ongoing tensions over free speech on college campuses and immigration policy debates that have dominated recent political discourse.\n\n#live #livenews #breakingnews #latestupdate #headlinenews #newsalert #livecoverage #trendingnews #worldnews #exclusivenews \nSUBSCRIBE NOW | https://bit.ly/SubscribeToMirrorNow\nFor More Updates ► http://www.mirrornownews.com\nLike us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Twitter ► https://twitter.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Instagram ► https://www.instagram.com/mirrornow_in/\n\nSubscribe to our other network channels:\nTimes Now Navbharat: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToTNNavbharat\nZoom: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToZoom\nTimes Now: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToTimesNow\nET Now: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToETNow\nTN+: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToTNPlus",

During the event, Kirk defended President Trump's cabinet appointments against criticism, argued for the elimination of the Department of Education, and engaged in extensive discussions about immigration policy. The debates covered topics ranging from Pete Hegseth's military leadership qualifications to the economic impact of illegal immigration, with Kirk maintaining his characteristic rapid-fire debating style against prepared student questioners. The event highlighted ongoing tensions over free speech on college campuses and immigration policy debates that have dominated recent political discourse.\n\n#live #livenews #breakingnews #latestupdate #headlinenews #newsalert #livecoverage #trendingnews #worldnews #exclusivenews \nSUBSCRIBE NOW | https://bit.ly/SubscribeToMirrorNow\nFor More Updates ► http://www.mirrornownews.com\nLike us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Twitter ► https://twitter.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Instagram ► https://www.instagram.com/mirrornow_in/\n\nSubscribe to our other network channels:\nTimes Now Navbharat: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToTNNavbharat\nZoom: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToZoom\nTimes Now: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToTimesNow\nET Now: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToETNow\nTN+: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToTNPlus"

        "description": "The Huge Conversation with Mark Zuckerberg...\n\nI interviewed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg before Connect. There are not many people with more power over our future. Right now, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are imagining the future billions of people might live in, soon, and building towards it. So, in this conversation, my goal is to figure out what that future looks like.
