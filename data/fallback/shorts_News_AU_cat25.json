          "description": "In recent weeks, Nepal has witnessed some of its largest youth-led demonstrations in decades. The protests began after the government suddenly blocked access to popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and X unless they registered locally. For many young people, this felt like an attack on their freedom of expression and their way of connecting with the world.\n\nWhat started as anger over the social media ban quickly grew into something bigger. Young Nepalis began voicing frustration over corruption, political favoritism, and the privileges enjoyed by the children of powerful leaders. Online, this anger was captured by the “Nepo Kid” trend, which highlighted the gap between political elites and ordinary citizens.\n\nCrowds of students and young workers gathered across cities, even defying curfews. Their chants and slogans called not only for the return of social media access but also for deeper changes in governance. The protests gained momentum and soon spread across the country, with people demanding more accountability and fairness from their leaders.\n\nAs the movement grew, the pressure on the government became impossible to ignore. Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli announced his resignation, and other officials followed. The social media restrictions were lifted, but many protesters insisted that this was only the first step. They continue to call for long-term reforms to reduce corruption and ensure that young voices are heard in the country’s future.\n\nThis moment has shown the power of Nepal’s younger generation. By standing together, they demonstrated that they can bring about real change. Their energy and determination have reshaped the political conversation in the country, marking the beginning of a new chapter.\n\nSubscribe for more educational content and unlock knowledge every day with FactTechz!",
