There is also a push/pull/legs version and upper/lower version available!\n\nI specifically designed this program to MAXIMIZE muscle growth and over the course of the next several months we will use brand-new exercises, intensity techniques, and cues you‚Äôve never heard of before, based on the latest hypertrophy science.\n\nAll of the popular ‚Äúbro‚Äù bodybuilding programs lack scientific structure and most of the other ‚Äúscience-based‚Äù programs on the market are repetitive and boring. This is the only program I‚Äôve ever seen that combines the best of both worlds. It has the enjoyment of field-tested ‚Äúbro‚Äù techniques and uses science-based training methods that actually work.\n\nI want this program to get you better results than any program you‚Äôve ever run, regardless of your current training status.\n\nThis is the ONLY program I've ever released that is 100% focused on pure bodybuilding and it‚Äôs also the program I‚Äôve put the most effort into making (by far). \n\nThis isn‚Äôt a generic powerlifting program. This isn‚Äôt a run-of-the-mill fitness routine. This is PURE BODYBUILDING.\n\nLearn more here: https://jeffnippard.com\n\nIn this short, I'm showing an example of a workout from the full body version of the program:\n\n1. Cross-Body Lat Pull-Arounds: 3x10-12\n2. Low Incline Smith Machine Press: 3x8-10\n3. Machine Hip Adduction: 3x10-12\n4. Leg Press: 3x8\n5. Lying Paused Rope Facepull: 3x10-12\n6.

            "description": "During this pandemic, we are all susceptible to weight gain. Since we can't go for a run or to the gym and we're stuck at home, it's easy to get sucked in to a cycle of eating, watching, sleeping. If you add working out into the chemistry, then you stand a chance at having a healthy and fit body despite having no chance to go out of the house!\n\nThese exercises can be done at home and they're all body-weight so there's no need to use any equipment. All you need is your body and your devices (mobile, laptop, TV) to get this party started!\n\nToday's 20-min full body workout guarantees weight loss results in no time. With discipline and a healthy diet, this workout will give you an amazing figure and a healthy body even during quarantine.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Let's begin the workout and start seeing results!‚ù§Ô∏èüí™"
