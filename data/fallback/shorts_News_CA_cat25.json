          "description": "In recent weeks, Nepal has witnessed some of its largest youth-led demonstrations in decades. The protests began after the government suddenly blocked access to popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and X unless they registered locally. For many young people, this felt like an attack on their freedom of expression and their way of connecting with the world.\n\nWhat started as anger over the social media ban quickly grew into something bigger. Young Nepalis began voicing frustration over corruption, political favoritism, and the privileges enjoyed by the children of powerful leaders. Online, this anger was captured by the “Nepo Kid” trend, which highlighted the gap between political elites and ordinary citizens.\n\nCrowds of students and young workers gathered across cities, even defying curfews. Their chants and slogans called not only for the return of social media access but also for deeper changes in governance. The protests gained momentum and soon spread across the country, with people demanding more accountability and fairness from their leaders.\n\nAs the movement grew, the pressure on the government became impossible to ignore. Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli announced his resignation, and other officials followed. The social media restrictions were lifted, but many protesters insisted that this was only the first step. They continue to call for long-term reforms to reduce corruption and ensure that young voices are heard in the country’s future.\n\nThis moment has shown the power of Nepal’s younger generation. By standing together, they demonstrated that they can bring about real change. Their energy and determination have reshaped the political conversation in the country, marking the beginning of a new chapter.\n\nSubscribe for more educational content and unlock knowledge every day with FactTechz!",

            "title": "Nepal Country is ON FIRE! DANGEROUS Social Media Protest #shorts",
            "description": "In recent weeks, Nepal has witnessed some of its largest youth-led demonstrations in decades. The protests began after the government suddenly blocked access to popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and X unless they registered locally. For many young people, this felt like an attack on their freedom of expression and their way of connecting with the world.\n\nWhat started as anger over the social media ban quickly grew into something bigger. Young Nepalis began voicing frustration over corruption, political favoritism, and the privileges enjoyed by the children of powerful leaders. Online, this anger was captured by the “Nepo Kid” trend, which highlighted the gap between political elites and ordinary citizens.\n\nCrowds of students and young workers gathered across cities, even defying curfews. Their chants and slogans called not only for the return of social media access but also for deeper changes in governance. The protests gained momentum and soon spread across the country, with people demanding more accountability and fairness from their leaders.\n\nAs the movement grew, the pressure on the government became impossible to ignore. Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli announced his resignation, and other officials followed. The social media restrictions were lifted, but many protesters insisted that this was only the first step. They continue to call for long-term reforms to reduce corruption and ensure that young voices are heard in the country’s future.\n\nThis moment has shown the power of Nepal’s younger generation. By standing together, they demonstrated that they can bring about real change. Their energy and determination have reshaped the political conversation in the country, marking the beginning of a new chapter.\n\nSubscribe for more educational content and unlock knowledge every day with FactTechz!"

          "description": "Watch the full episode here - https://youtu.be/2h00Q0Fjah8\n\n“We all have a #MeToo story — we’ve all been through difficult situations on public transport, schools, colleges, and tuitions. While most of us have internalised this whole thing and decided, ‘I’ll be more careful next time,’ there were a few who chose to speak up about their plight. The culprits were named and shamed, and yet, no action was taken. What was the point of it all, then? \nI believe this is why we need more women in positions of power. So those women can lend courage and support to others and tell them, ‘You’re not alone!’”\n\nCurrently the Managing Editor of Firstpost, Palki Sharma Upadhyay is not just a name in the world of journalism; she is a beacon of excellence, integrity, and dedication. With her unwavering commitment to truth, her insightful analysis, and her captivating storytelling, Palki has carved a niche for herself in the media industry.\n\nFrom covering historic elections to reporting from conflict zones, Palki has been on the frontlines, bringing us the news that shapes our world. Her keen investigative skills have led her to unravel complex political scandals, humanitarian crises, and social issues, giving voice to the voiceless and shedding light on the stories that need to be told.\n\nBeyond her professional achievements, Palki Sharma Upadhyay is a strong woman who has challenged and changed the narrative about a ‘working mother’, and aspires to change the way newsrooms work. \n\nJoin us in uncovering Palki Sharma’s journey as she shares her insights, experiences, and the incredible stories she has gathered during her illustrious career. \n\nWe talked about: \n. Finding her calling in journalism\n. Childhood days\n. Beginning her career with Doordarshan\n. Take on the evolution of news\n. Ethics in Journalism\n. On-ground experiences, reporting from conflict zones\n. Take on ‘no news’\n. Finding a balance\n. Motherhood \n. Feminism in newsrooms\n. Self-acceptance\n.

            "description": "Watch the full episode here - https://youtu.be/2h00Q0Fjah8\n\n“We all have a #MeToo story — we’ve all been through difficult situations on public transport, schools, colleges, and tuitions. While most of us have internalised this whole thing and decided, ‘I’ll be more careful next time,’ there were a few who chose to speak up about their plight. The culprits were named and shamed, and yet, no action was taken. What was the point of it all, then? \nI believe this is why we need more women in positions of power. So those women can lend courage and support to others and tell them, ‘You’re not alone!’”\n\nCurrently the Managing Editor of Firstpost, Palki Sharma Upadhyay is not just a name in the world of journalism; she is a beacon of excellence, integrity, and dedication. With her unwavering commitment to truth, her insightful analysis, and her captivating storytelling, Palki has carved a niche for herself in the media industry.\n\nFrom covering historic elections to reporting from conflict zones, Palki has been on the frontlines, bringing us the news that shapes our world. Her keen investigative skills have led her to unravel complex political scandals, humanitarian crises, and social issues, giving voice to the voiceless and shedding light on the stories that need to be told.\n\nBeyond her professional achievements, Palki Sharma Upadhyay is a strong woman who has challenged and changed the narrative about a ‘working mother’, and aspires to change the way newsrooms work. \n\nJoin us in uncovering Palki Sharma’s journey as she shares her insights, experiences, and the incredible stories she has gathered during her illustrious career. \n\nWe talked about: \n. Finding her calling in journalism\n. Childhood days\n. Beginning her career with Doordarshan\n. Take on the evolution of news\n. Ethics in Journalism\n. On-ground experiences, reporting from conflict zones\n. Take on ‘no news’\n. Finding a balance\n. Motherhood \n. Feminism in newsrooms\n. Self-acceptance\n.
